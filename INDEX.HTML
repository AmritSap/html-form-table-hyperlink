    <h3>how to learn coding faster</h3>
    <p>It is crucial to establish which direction you want to go, and why do you want to learn code in the first place. Setting your goal first will give you motivation and commitment toward learning. For example, if youâ€™re going to become a web developer, searching for the best online course to start with is your best bet. However, if you want to try out and experience on what is a programming language or to give an intuition on what this major is about, learning from interactive websites are your best options. Nevertheless, I would recommend for the beginner to get started with a high-level language such as Python Programming Language since it is easier for them to understand the logic.</p>
